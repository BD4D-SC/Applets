# Applets

We provide here several applets for a pedagogical purpose. The applets aim at giving an intuition of a statistical method by focusing on its main principle. Thus, they often consider simplified situations, contrarily to the courses of Wikistat, which go deeper into details, or to the notebooks on real case studies.

We hope that they will be a good complementary tool for learning. 
To start, run the notebook wikistatsApp.ipynb.
Play and enjoy!
